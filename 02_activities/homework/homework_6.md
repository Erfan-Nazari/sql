**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

We need to consider the ethical side of the data we're collceting, storing and working with. If the data includes personal and sensitive info. like customer personal details, patient's medical history, and so on, you should consider special privacy considerations about who have access to these personal data, they are stored in a safe storage, and if you don't need any of these data don't collect and store them at all.

Another important point is that to make sure that the design of our database is such that it promots diversity, equity and inclusion. This involves making sure our datasets represent different populations and getting input from underrepresented groups. A few examples are not having strict limits like number of characters for the first name and last name, not having binary or not enough choices for gender, and not having any restrictiction on personal stuff like mariage status.

We should also make sure that our models and analysis of data are not biases and as a result an underrepresented group of people are not affected by this bias. If that is the case, we need to find ways to fix these isues. One practical step is to use fairness metrics or sensitivity analysis in our analysis.
